### :: Summary

![logo](http://www.bionimio.com.ar/imgGitHub/serverTUIO.jpg)

Program designed to receive TUIO protocol events and forward them to a Flash application through a local server. 
The idea of the program is to analyze and keep track of stains or not, 
and forward the application FLASH or spots between the scene captured by the webcam.
Turn has an FSM (finite state machine) who tested each one of more spots to substantiate its existence in time,
thus attempting to correct the care generated by the webcam.

Testing: Processing 1.5
